# landing-page
My First Landing Page

I will be using flexbox with CSS and HTML with free-to-use images.

After doing the second "info" section of the landing page I noticed that the flexiblity distored the elements too much so I made the necassary changes to make the elements on both sections, stay the same size when the browser window is resized. In the future I hope to learn and implement better responsiveness for the website so that everything can shrink proportionately or wrap inside the page to where it looks good on smaller screens. (It also say's in the TOP page that it is okay for this not to work as I will be learning more about this in the future).
